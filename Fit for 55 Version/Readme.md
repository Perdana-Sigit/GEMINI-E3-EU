Fit for 55 Version

This version of GEMINI-E3 EU is the one used to simulate first scenarios of the Fit for 55 package.
The folder content the gams files to simulate the model and an excel sheet to visualize the result in the IPCC format.
To run the model you need to have some gdx files that require a GTAP licence of the GTAP 11 dabase https://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/databases/v11/
These gdx files would be send after a proof of the GTAP licence.

The folder includes the paper "Integrating Spatial Granularity into Climate Policy Analysis: A CGEâ€“GIS Framework for the European Union" that descibes the scenarios
simulated by this model.
